# 0x03. Sandpiles

## 0. Sandpiles sum

### Write a function that computes the sum of two sandpiles

Prototype: void sandpiles_sum(int grid1[3][3], int grid2[3][3]);<br>
You can assume that both grid1 and grid2 are individually stable<br>
A sandpile is considered stable when none of its cells contains more than 3 grains<br>
When your function is done, grid1 must be stable<br>
grid1 must be printed before each toppling round, only if it is unstable (See example)<br>
Youâ€™re not allowed to allocate memory dynamically<br>
